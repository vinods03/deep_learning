# CNN - Animal Multi Class Classification.ipynb

Image Classification Problem - multiple classes
Includes Strided Convolution layer, GlobalMaxPooling / Flatten, Dense, Batch Normalization, Data Augmentation. 
We also see the misclassified examples and predict the class given an image.

# CNN - Pneumonia detection - Binary Class Classification.ipynb

Image Classification Problem - binary class
Predict whether a patient has pneumonia or not using the Lung X-Ray Image

# 44. Project - Stratified Shuffle Split.ipynb

Predict the revenue grid of a bank customer given other parameters like income, occupation etc.
Using StratifiedShuffleSplit instead of train_test_split to take care of class imbalance in the target variable

# ANN_Housing_Price.ipynb

Deep learning regression to predict the housing price. Improved Adjusted R-squared value from ~60% to ~90%
One hot encoding for numeric values holding categorical info, scaling etc helped improve the model

# CNN Celebrity Actors.ipynb

Identify teh actor based on image.
Data augmentation and multi-layer neural network helped improve the accuracy to 96%

# CNN_Human_Action_Recognition.ipynb

Identify the human action based on image.
Accuracy good but validation accuracy low
Tried many new options like regularizers to improve the model
Also tried different options for image generator, number of layers in the neural network, learning rate etc.

# CNN_Covid19.ipynb

Multi-class classification problem.
Based on lung X-ray, identify if the customer has Covid, Viral Pneumonia or is normal.

# CNN_Weather.ipynb

Multi-class classification problem.
Determine if satellite image is cloudy / water / desert / green area
